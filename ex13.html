                Dandoon by manufacturers and various stakeholders of latex industry, GOLS became a globally recognized
                standard for products made out of organically grown natural rubber latex. Originally developed by
                Control Union, GOLS adds value to companies seeking more sustainable products.

                The aim of the standard is to recognize products which may include, but not limited to, mattress &
                bedding products, gloves, bands, shoe soles, rubber toys, condoms and any other product made out of
                organically grown natural rubber latex. These products may contain not only certified natural rubber
                latex but also other approved additional materials and accessories. In order to label the final product
                as GOLS it is paramount that all the raw materials in the product (other than approved additional
                materials/accessories) comply with the requirements on organic origin.

                The standard addresses criteria for natural rubber latex and any other agriculture ingredients from
                certified organic plantations (USDA NOP or EU) that is processed as GOLS certified manufacturing units.
                The GOLS standard features permissible limits for harmful substances, emission test requirements and
                polymer and filler percentages.

                By using transaction certificates at every sale of a product in the supply chain, traceability from the
                plantation to the final retailer is ensured.
