      Death Note southeast of Tunis, Sfax (Ṣafāqis) is the second largest city in Tunisia, home to 211.
      301 people as of 20141.
      Despite its weight in the country’s economical and cultural life, it has not received as much attention
      from dialectologists as
      ther areas may have2. As a matter of fact, to the best of our knowledge, there are only two references
      available. The first one da
      back to 1907 and is a body of texts collected by Karl Narbeshuber (Aus dem Leben der arabischen Bevölkerung
      in Sfax Regentschaft T
      unis). The second one, more recent, is a short description written by Dhouha Lajmi in 2009. In her paper, the
      author regards Sfax
      and its countryside as a separate dialectal area, since it “presents very specific characteristics”. Aside from t
      initial commen
      a thorough analysis of the original data collected in September 2016 could help show in what ways the Sfaxi
      dialect stands out
      from the other Tunisian pre-Hilali dialects. The present paper is a preliminary study of the dialect spoken by the
      elderly
      inhabitants of the Old City. As it appears to be, it differs from the one spoken by their younger counterparts and
      from the o
      ne spoken outside of the walls. I intentionally chose to focus my efforts on these speakers in order to show the
      most
      outstand
      g features that can be regarded as retained archaisms.

      2The fieldwork took place in September 2016, where I recorded eight people: two women and four men (born between
      1930 and 1950)
      who have


      lived in the Old City their whole life, and two young men and an old lady outside the Old City. These last
      recordings will only be used
      points of reference, as they are the most representative of today’s Sfaxi dialect, which falls beyond the scope of
      this article.

      3As mentioned above, Sfax is a major city in Tunisia, and has been throughout history. The medina as seen today
      was founded in 849
      betwe
      en the ruins of ancient Roman Taparura and Thanae, by the Aghlabid ʕAlī Ibn Aslam al-Bakrī. Taparura was first
      mentioned in Ptolemy’s
      Geography
      around the year 140, and was one of Africa’s bishoprics during the 5th Century (Du Paty De Clam 1890: 6). After
      these mentions, the
      Roman toponym
      disappears and Sfax is the only name referring to the city, which remained under Roman rule until 655, when the
      Arabs started
      occupying it. The inhabitants
      of the city rebelled during the 11th C and Sfax was independent for a short period of time, before falling under
      Sicilian rule in 1148. Afterwards, its fate didn’t differ much
      from the fate of the other Tunisian cities. Its dialect though, seems to have taken a very different direction
      from the other
      Tunisian pre-Hilali varieties
